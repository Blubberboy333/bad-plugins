Overview
--------

Very simple plugin that simplifies the login process... Instead of
asking for commands, users simply chat away...

### Register process

Player connects for the first time.  They are prompted to enter a
*NEW* password.  They enter their password directly, without having to
enter */register*.

They are asked for the password again to confirm.  They re-enter their
password (again without */register*).

### Login process

Player connects agian.  They are prompted to enter their login
password.  They type their login password directly (without
*/login*).  And they are in.
